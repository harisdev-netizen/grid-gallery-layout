## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** for semantic structure.
- **CSS3** with custom properties and CSS Grid for layout.
- **Responsive Design** principles using media queries.
- **Desktop-first Workflow** for structured scalability.

### What I Learned

This project improved my understanding of:

- Crafting responsive and adaptable layouts using `grid-area` &  `grid-template-areas`.
- Utilizing `gap` and `border-radius` for polished designs.
- Implementing media queries effectively to adjust grid layouts across screen sizes.
- Managing image scaling and maintaining aspect ratios with `object-fit`.

## Future Improvements

- Add hover effects or transitions to enhance interactivity.
- Optimize images for faster loading times across devices.
- Extend the layout by incorporating dynamic data with JavaScript.
- Experiment with more complex CSS Grid configurations for advanced use cases.
